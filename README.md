# CS463G Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2020) Projects

This repository is a group of Python projects completed during the University of Kentucky's CS463G Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2020) class.

The goal of this class was to learn the theory and practice of AI concepts such as:
- intelligent agents
- search and game-playing
- logical systems
- planning systems
- uncertainty -- probability theory, inference, and decision theory

Each project has an associated README to describe its functionality in depth:
- [Master Pyraminx Model](./MasterPyraminxModel/README.md)
- [A* Master Pyraminx Solver](./AStarPyraminxSolver/README.md)
